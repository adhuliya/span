"""Synergistic Program ANalyzer (SPAN) library.

SPAN is an analysis framework built around SPAN IR.
SPAN IR is a rich pythonic three-address-code IR that can represent any C99 program.
SPAN IR is generated from CLANG AST, using a checker called
`SlangGenAst` that converts AST for a C99 compliant program,
to the python based SPAN IR.
