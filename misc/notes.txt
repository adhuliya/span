PhD work items

Clarify the use of policy() and explicate that the usage is not analysis specific — add examples.

Publish/Submit a paper — Target paper — decide on the content.

Some examples may be very helpful to the reader.

Rewrite introduction to better introduce and compare with Lerner’s approach + manual approach.

Treat the related work with more detail in the related works section.

Make the background section more concise, removing redundant details.

Add formal proof for forward-backward analysis and show its benefits.

Add proof of equivalence between SPAN and a couple of analyses pair?

Show experimental comparisons with manually written super-analyses.
    - [ ] Show results on some SPEC benchmarks.


Does Lerner’s approach work for inter-procedural?
* Some feature that doesn’t work in Lerner’s but works in ours.


Difference with Lerner/Craig/Groov's approach:
1. Transformations preserve relation to the source program.
2. Termination and MFP guarantee.
3. On-demand vs forced transformation.
4. Forward-Backward analysis -- or live variables can work with other analyses.

* Finish the implementation and get the numbers -- +forward-backward
  * Highlight the rows where SPAN is better.
* Revert to the previous paper structures -- with improvements as per reviews.
	* policy, lerner's comparison, background, manual analyses etc.
* Formalization of forward-backward. Move forward-backward to a later chapter (possbily separate chapter).
* Add deadlines to the tasks.
* TO DISCUSS: Is SPAN approximate the reduced cross-product?
